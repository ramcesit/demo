I have always been passionate about mentoring, having come from an Academia background. This was revived as a result of my involvement with the TFG-AIML community, where I helped fellow team members through various training programs to enhance their AI skills. I am delighted and grateful that our organization has given us these amazing opportunities. Additionally, this platform has helped me to make new connections and broaden my network considerably.
