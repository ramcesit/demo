This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. Variations of the tf-idf weighting scheme are often used by search engines as a central tool in scoring and ranking a document's relevance given a user query.\n\nOne of the simplest ranking functions is computed by summing the tf-idf for each query term; many more sophisticated ranking functions are variants of this simple model.\n\nTypically, the tf-idf weight is composed by two terms: the first computes the normalized Term Frequency (TF), aka. the number of times a word appears in a document, divided by the total number of words in that document; the second term is the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), computed as the logarithm of the number of the documents in the corpus divided by the number of documents where the specific term appears.\n\n**TF: Term Frequency**, which measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. Since every document is different in length, it is possible that a term would appear much more times in long documents than shorter ones. Thus, the term frequency is often divided by the document length (aka. the total number of terms in the document) as a way of normalization: \n\n*TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) / (Total number of terms in the document).*\n\n**IDF: Inverse Document Frequency**, which measures how important a term is. While computing TF, all terms are considered equally important. However it is known that certain terms, such as \"is\", \"of\", and \"that\", may appear a lot of times but have little importance. Thus we need to weigh down the frequent terms while scale up the rare ones, by computing the following: \n\n*IDF(t) = log_e(Total number of documents / Number of documents with term t in it).*\n\nSee below for a simple example.\n\n**Example:**\n\nConsider a document containing 100 words wherein the word cat appears 3 times. \n\nThe term frequency (i.e., tf) for cat is then (3 / 100) = 0.03. Now, assume we have 10 million documents and the word cat appears in one thousand of these. Then, the inverse document frequency (i.e., idf) is calculated as log(10,000,000 / 1,000) = 4. Thus, the Tf-idf weight is the product of these quantities: 0.03 * 4 = 0.12.\n____\n\nLet's go ahead and see how we can do this in SciKit Learn:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3a9ae2839793ada9dd4914750a7fec0f31640d41"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfTransformer\ntfidf_transformer=TfidfTransformer().fit(messages_bow)\ntfidf4 = tfidf_transformer.transform(bow4)\nprint(tfidf4)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"69690168ab7a736a9fa22e2a5fe7aeeeb20b9e64"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We'll go ahead and check what is the IDF (inverse document frequency) of the word `\"u\"` and of word `\"university\"`?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2f2fff75079767f27aea5785d88ae485c1602a11"},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(tfidf_transformer.idf_[bow_transformer.vocabulary_['u']])\nprint(tfidf_transformer.idf_[bow_transformer.vocabulary_['university']])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"bacb5be16f8664e102d3cde0403345cfb4d7ace0"},"cell_type":"code","source":"messages_tfidf=tfidf_transformer.transform(messages_bow)\nprint(messages_tfidf.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c10784a772d83f3d6cbeea66cc53a6fd6e650906"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are many ways the data can be preprocessed and vectorized.

If we simply remembered each example during training, the accuracy on training data would trivially be 100%, even though we wouldn't be able to classify any new messages.\n\nA proper way is to split the data into a training/test set, where the model only ever sees the **training data** during its model fitting and parameter tuning. The **test data** is never used in any way. This is then our final evaluation on test data is representative of true predictive performance.\n\n## Train Test Split"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1220b3cc2df7226c69142385389249f6184431f0"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nmsg_train,msg_test,label_train,label_test = train_test_split(message['message'],message['labels'],test_size=0.2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"4d02357c5e4fc2ed9559137d536bd36b79f9aec5"},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(len(msg_train),len(msg_test),len(label_train),len(label_test))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"bc9fac58a3cf747268d12e1c7ae4ffd5614d768a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The test size is 20% of the entire dataset (1115 messages out of total 5572), and the training is the rest (4457 out of 5572).
